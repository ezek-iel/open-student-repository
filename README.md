# Open Student Repository (OSR)

The **Open Student Repository** is an open-source directory of free and discounted student materials. Our goal is simple: help students save money while sourcing academic resources.  

---

> [!TIP]
> OSR is built **by students, for students**. We encourage student developers to contribute, improve, and expand this project.  
> For details on contributing, see the [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## 🚀 Hosting Locally

OSR is built with **TypeScript** and the **Vite** toolchain. To run it locally:

1. Install dependencies (we recommend `pnpm`, but `npm` works too):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   > 💡 You can also set up a personal SQLite database file for mock data. This can be curled and used for testing purposes.

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **SvelteKit** → Routing, server-side rendering, forms  
- **PostgreSQL / Supabase** → Storage and database management  
- **FTS5** → Full-text search and text retrieval  
- **Vercel** → Deployment

## 📌 Roadmap

We’re currently focused on **expanding the number of materials** available in the repository.  
No AI integrations… *yet*.
